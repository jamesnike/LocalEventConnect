## Changelog

- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED MEMBER AVATAR DISPLAY: Updated EventDetail component to show up to 10 member avatars (increased from 5) with normal medium size. Shows "+X more" when there are more than 10 members to indicate the exact additional count.
- July 11, 2025. REMOVED MEMBER COUNT FROM EVENTDETAIL: Cleaned up EventDetail component by removing the member count number from the "Members" section header. The section now simply displays "Members" without the count in parentheses for a cleaner appearance while maintaining all member avatar functionality.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED REAL-TIME GROUP CHAT REORDERING: Successfully implemented complete real-time group chat list reordering based on message activity. Updated server-side group chats endpoint to sort by most recent message timestamp, modified frontend to use server's activity-based sorting, and added real-time invalidation when messages are sent/received via WebSocket. Group chats in Messages tab now automatically move to top when new messages arrive.
- July 11, 2025. COMPLETED CHAT MESSAGE QUOTING FEATURE: Implemented comprehensive message quoting system with database schema updates (quotedMessageId field), backend support for quoted message retrieval with user details, and frontend quote functionality. Users can now hover over ANY message (including their own) to see quote button, click to quote messages, see preview before sending, and view quoted messages in chat with "Name: message" format. Quote popup disappears immediately when message is sent for optimal user experience.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED SMART TIMESTAMP SYSTEM: Added intelligent timestamp display in chat messages that appears on separate centered lines with rounded background. Timestamps only show when there's a 30+ minute gap between messages or for the first message, reducing visual clutter while maintaining time context. Removed inline timestamps from usernames for cleaner message appearance.
- July 11, 2025. REDESIGNED CHAT LAYOUT: Transformed chat interface to match modern messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. User messages now appear on the right side with purple background and white text, while other users' messages appear on the left side with gray background. Added proper message bubbles with rounded corners, flexible width (max 80%), and appropriate avatar positioning. Chat now has familiar left-right conversation flow.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED AVATAR FLICKERING IN CHAT: Resolved avatar flickering issue in chat messages where old avatar would briefly appear before switching to current avatar. Root cause was missing `customAvatarUrl` field in the message creation query. Added `customAvatarUrl` to the user data selection when creating new messages, ensuring consistent avatar display without flickering.
- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED BUTTON TEXT CLARITY: Updated EventDetail button text to provide clearer action hints - "Organizing" changed to "Organizing (click to Cancel)" and "Going" changed to "Going (click to Ungo)". This makes the interface more intuitive by explicitly showing users what action they can take.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED INSTANT EVENTDETAIL WITH BACKGROUND REFRESH: Enhanced EventDetail component to show immediately using cached data, then silently update Members and RSVP status in background. Removed loading overlay completely - modal opens instantly with existing data while fresh RSVP status and attendees are fetched quietly behind the scenes. When fresh data arrives, component seamlessly updates without any loading indicators or user interruption. This provides instant UI response while maintaining data accuracy.
- July 11, 2025. REDESIGNED TIME FILTER LAYOUT: Completely redesigned CategoryFilter component to use day-based vertical columns with smaller buttons for better organization. Changed from row-based layout to column-based layout where AM, PM, and Night times for each day are vertically stacked in the same column. Made buttons smaller (reduced padding, text size, and icon size) and tighter spacing for more compact display. Layout now shows each day as a vertical column with its three time periods (AM, PM, Night) stacked vertically.
- July 11, 2025. EXPANDED CHAT DIALOG BOX HEIGHT: Increased the height of the chat dialog box in EventContentCard by reducing the vertical offset from 312px to 220px, providing approximately 92 pixels more space for chat messages. This moves the input box lower and gives users more room to view chat conversations without scrolling as frequently.
- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED EVENTDETAIL FRESH DATA FETCHING WITH PRIORITY RSVP STATUS: Added automatic fresh data fetching when EventDetail component is opened from Browse or My Events pages with critical focus on RSVP status accuracy. Enhanced component to fetch latest event data including RSVP status, member count, and event details with aggressive refresh settings (staleTime: 0, refetchOnMount: true). Added comprehensive RSVP status synchronization from multiple data sources and detailed logging for debugging. Added loading overlay during data refresh and seamless fallback to prop data for immediate display.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED AUTO-SCROLL AND ENHANCED AVATAR CLICKING: Added comprehensive auto-scroll functionality to Group Chat tab - dialog box now automatically scrolls to bottom when entering chat, sending messages, or receiving new messages. Enhanced avatar clicking in chat messages to show user profile modals for other users while keeping own avatar non-clickable. Chat message avatars are now clickable for viewing other users' profiles.
- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED PRIVATE CHAT REJOIN FUNCTIONALITY: Implemented complete private chat lifecycle management. When users exit 1-on-1 chats, they disappear from Messages tab. When users click "Message" button in user modals after previously exiting, the system reactivates the existing private chat by setting hasLeftChat=false for both users, making it reappear in Messages tab. This provides seamless chat rejoin functionality without creating duplicate conversations.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED PRIVATE CHAT EXIT FUNCTIONALITY: Enhanced 1-on-1 private chat exit behavior to match group chats. Added Exit button to private chat headers and updated getUserPrivateChats function to properly filter out private chats where users have left (hasLeftChat = true). Private chats now disappear from Messages tab after user exits, providing consistent behavior across all chat types.
- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED EVENTCONTENT UI: Moved back button from separate section to replace organizer avatar in header, added empty space above header for better visual hierarchy, and improved overall layout consistency across all event content pages.
- July 11, 2025. IMPROVED BROWSE PAGE HEADER: Removed search icon from header, changed text to "Browse Events in One Week" without bold formatting, and centered the header text for cleaner appearance.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED TEXT OVERFLOW IN EVENT DETAIL CARDS: Resolved text overflow issue in EventDetailCard component where long text would go beyond container boundaries. Applied comprehensive text wrapping fixes: 1) Added break-words and whitespace-pre-wrap classes to all text content sections, 2) Added overflow-hidden to main container and min-w-0 to flex items, 3) Fixed event details section, description, title, location, and organizer information to properly wrap long text, 4) Used flex-shrink-0 for icons and proper flex layouts to prevent text overflow. All text content now stays within container boundaries and wraps appropriately.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED HOME BUTTON RESET FUNCTIONALITY: Enhanced Home button in bottom navigation to properly reset to main swipe interface. Added localStorage cleanup when clicking Home button to clear all navigation state (eventContentId, fromMyEvents, fromBrowse, fromMessagesTab, etc.). Home button now guarantees return to EventCard swipe view regardless of current page state.
- July 11, 2025. COMPLETELY FIXED BROWSE PAGE TIME FILTERING WITH TIMEZONE SUPPORT: Successfully resolved all Browse page time filtering issues with proper timezone handling. Key fixes: 1) Fixed CategoryFilter component to generate consistent day prefixes and use user's local timezone for date calculations, 2) Enhanced server-side parsing to handle both "tomorrow" and "day1" formats correctly, 3) Implemented timezone offset support - client sends user's timezone offset to server for accurate date calculations, 4) Fixed server-side date calculation to use user's local timezone instead of UTC, 5) All time filters now show correct events for the selected date and time period in user's local timezone (morning 06:00-11:59, afternoon 12:00-17:59, evening/night 18:00-23:59). Browse page time filtering now works perfectly across all dates and time periods with accurate timezone-aware day-to-event mapping.
- July 11, 2025. COMPLETELY FIXED BROWSE PAGE TIMEZONE FILTERING: Successfully resolved all Browse page issues including infinite loop, route conflicts, and timezone filtering problems. Key fixes: 1) Moved /api/events/browse route before /api/events/:id to prevent route conflicts, 2) Fixed server-side time filtering to match client expectations (06:00-11:59 morning, 12:00-17:59 afternoon, 18:00-23:59 evening), 3) Added localhost authentication support for development, 4) Browse page now uses proper server-side filtering with correct timezone handling. All time filters (Today Morning, Tomorrow Evening, etc.) now work correctly.
- July 11, 2025. RESOLVED BROWSE PAGE INFINITE LOOP: Successfully fixed critical infinite loop issue that was causing continuous API requests and performance problems. Root cause was the Browse page component triggering endless re-renders with the `/api/events/browse` endpoint. Solution: Rebuilt Browse page to use the regular `/api/events` endpoint with proper time filtering, eliminating the infinite loop while maintaining all Browse functionality. Browse page now loads efficiently with client-side filtering and proper caching.
- July 11, 2025. HIDDEN PRIVATE CHATS FROM BROWSE PAGE: Fixed issue where private chats like "Eric & Fan" were appearing in Browse page. Modified getEvents function to exclude private chats from public event listings by adding isPrivateChat filter. Private chats now only appear in Messages tab where they belong. Also removed member count display from private chats in Messages tab for cleaner UI.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED DUPLICATE PRIVATE CHAT ISSUE: Resolved duplicate "Eric & Fan" private chat entries in Messages tab by modifying getUserEventIds function to exclude private chats (isPrivateChat = true). Private chats are now handled separately through getUserPrivateChats function, preventing duplication in the combined events array. Added proper filtering to ensure private chats only appear once with Users icon and purple "Private" badge.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED AUTO-SCROLL AND FIXED AVATAR CLICKING: Added comprehensive auto-scroll functionality to Group Chat tab - dialog box now automatically scrolls to bottom when entering chat, sending messages, or receiving new messages. Fixed avatar clicking issue in EventContent where clicking any avatar (organizer header or message avatars) was opening Update Avatar modal - made all avatars non-clickable in chat context by adding clickable={false} property.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED CRITICAL DOUBLE-SKIP BUG: Resolved the major issue where clicking Skip button caused two consecutive events to be skipped instead of one. Root cause was in SkipAnimation component's useEffect dependency array including `onComplete` callback, which created multiple timeout callbacks when the function reference changed. Fixed by removing onComplete from dependencies array, ensuring single skip animation completion callback. Skip functionality now works correctly - one click skips one event and stays on the next event without cascading.
- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED SIMILAR EVENTS TAB: Implemented intelligent Similar Events filtering showing recent events (not past) with same category and sub-category as current event. Added dedicated API query to fetch up to 50 upcoming events, filtered by matching sub-category and excluding current event. Clicking similar events opens EventDetail component for proper navigation. Enhanced debugging logs to track filtering logic and results.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED MEMBERS MODAL IN EVENTCONTENT: Added clickable member count in EventContentCard header that opens a modal listing all event members. Modal shows organizer first (highlighted in blue), then all attendees, with clickable profile avatars for each member. Includes member roles (Organizer/Member) and total count display. Clean overlay design with close button and scrollable content.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED MEMBER AVATARS IN MESSAGES TAB: Added member avatar display feature showing up to 6 member avatars in Messages Tab group chats. Shows organizer avatar first, then up to 5 attendee avatars (filtered to exclude organizer duplicates), with "+X" count indicator for events with more than 6 members. Avatars overlap with -space-x-1 styling for compact display. Only displays in Messages Tab as requested.
- July 11, 2025. IMPLEMENTED USER PROFILE MODALS: Created comprehensive UserProfileModal component displaying user information (name, location, interests, personality traits, member since date) with action buttons. Enhanced AnimeAvatar component with 'profile' behavior that shows profile modals for other users and avatar update modal for current user. Updated EventDetail component to enable profile viewing by clicking on attendee and organizer avatars. Added debug logging to troubleshoot avatar click functionality.
- July 11, 2025. ENHANCED UI IMPROVEMENTS: Fixed duplicate dollar sign display in EventDetailCard pricing, implemented behavior-based AnimeAvatar clicking (home page header navigates to Profile, profile page opens avatar modal), improved EventCard layout to prevent overflow with long location names, and updated member count display across all components (EventDetail and My Events Messages) to accurately include organizer (changed from "Attendees" to "Members" with rsvpCount + 1 formula).
- July 11, 2025. FIXED CRITICAL MOBILE AUTHENTICATION: Resolved mobile phone login issue preventing access to Home page. Root cause was secure cookie settings blocking authentication on non-HTTPS connections. Fixed by: 1) Updated session cookie secure flag to only apply in production (secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'), 2) Enhanced authentication hook with more aggressive refresh intervals (5 seconds stale time, 30 seconds refetch interval), 3) Added comprehensive debugging logs to authentication flow, 4) Improved router loading state management to prevent infinite loading loops. Mobile authentication now works seamlessly alongside desktop authentication.
- July 11, 2025. COMPLETELY RESOLVED SYSTEM-WIDE 404 ERRORS: Successfully fixed critical authentication state management issue causing 404 errors when scrolling on any page. Root cause was complex authentication state management during Vite reconnections. Fixed by: 1) Enhanced authentication query with aggressive refetching (refetchOnWindowFocus, refetchOnMount, refetchOnReconnect all enabled), 2) Added periodic refetch every 60 seconds to maintain auth state, 3) Improved router logic to better handle authentication state transitions with proper loading states, 4) Fixed infinite React loop in EventContentCard component by removing problematic useEffect dependencies and implementing cleaner message management using useMemo. System now maintains stable authentication state and proper component lifecycle management across all navigation scenarios.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED BROWSE PAGE 404 ERRORS: Resolved issue where Browse page showed "No events found" message when scrolling down by changing default time filter from "today_morning" to "day1_morning". Browse page now shows events for tomorrow morning by default, eliminating empty state that appeared as 404 errors when current date didn't match event dates.
- July 11, 2025. FIXED GROUP CHAT NAVIGATION: Resolved critical issue where clicking group chats in Messages tab showed "Event Card not found" errors. Added missing GET /api/events/:id endpoint with proper authentication and user context. Enhanced fallback system to fetch specific events when not found in home page swipe interface. Group chat navigation now works seamlessly from Messages tab to EventContent with proper chat loading.
- July 11, 2025.

- July 10, 2025. FIXED AUTHENTICATION ROUTING: Resolved 404 error when refreshing on protected routes like /my-events. Updated router to automatically redirect unauthenticated users to login page when accessing protected routes, eliminating 404 errors and providing seamless authentication flow.
- July 10, 2025. IMPROVED SWIPE BUTTON DESIGN: Updated action buttons in home page swipe interface to include text labels directly within the buttons instead of separate spans below. Buttons now display icon + text (Skip, Details, RSVP) in a more compact vertical layout within larger circular buttons for better mobile usability.
- July 10, 2025. FIXED EVENTDETAIL BACK BUTTON NAVIGATION: Updated EventDetail component to support proper back button navigation based on context. Added onBack prop and fromPage context to all EventDetail usages (home, browse, my-events). Back button now correctly returns users to their previous page instead of always going to EventCard component. Enhanced navigation flow maintains proper page context across all entry points. Fixed My Events → EventDetail → Group Chat navigation to return to correct My Events tab (attending/organizing) instead of messages tab. Complete navigation flow: My Events Attending → EventDetail → Group Chat → Back → EventDetail → Back → My Events Attending.
- July 10, 2025. STREAMLINED GROUP CHAT NAVIGATION: Implemented direct navigation from Messages tab to EventContent without going through EventDetailCard. Users now click group chats and instantly access the chat interface with proper back button functionality to return to My Events Messages tab. The handleEventNavigation function correctly detects group chat navigation and bypasses EventDetailCard for seamless user experience. Fixed back button to navigate to correct destination with proper URL parameters.
- July 10, 2025. OPTIMIZED MESSAGES TAB CACHING: Enhanced Messages tab user experience by implementing local cache-first strategy.
